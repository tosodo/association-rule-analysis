Analysis of Association Rules for Bakery Products

This repository explores association rules between bakery products, aiming to identify patterns in customer purchases that can inform product placement and marketing strategies.

Introduction

Analyzing customer purchase data at a bakery can reveal valuable insights into buying habits and product relationships. Association rule mining helps us discover frequently bought product combinations.

Data

This analysis uses a dataset containing bakery product sales data (replace with specific details about your data source and format).

Methodology

We utilize the mlxtend library in Python to generate association rules. The minimum lift threshold is set to 1.0 to focus on rules where the observed association is stronger than expected by chance.# association-rule-analysis
